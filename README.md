## 📱 App Idea:
We've developed an app to help young adults learn about investment and trading, specifically focusing on cryptocurrencies. It's not just about teaching through media or books; it's an interactive platform where users can simulate real-time crypto investments using our custom local coin, blu coin.

## 💡 Features and Pages (Android App):
1️⃣ Home Page: Provides an overview of the user coins and its balance.

2️⃣ Wallet Page: Displays the user's balance and allows them to manage their coins and see their transactions between their friends.

3️⃣ Buy Coin: Enables users to purchase different cryptocurrencies using blu coin.

4️⃣ Sell Coin: Allows users to sell their owned cryptocurrencies and convert them into blu coin.

5️⃣ Educational Platform: Offers educational content, including posts and blogs, to learn about financial markets, trading strategies, and banking terminologies.

6️⃣ Tips and Notifications: Send tips about investment techiques and loss risks.

## 🔧 Technical Details (Cordova):
The frontend of our app is developed using Cordova (🔌), which utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a cross-platform mobile application. Cordova allows us to leverage web technologies and build a user-friendly interface for our app.

## 🔙 Backend (Django APIs and DRF):
The backend of our app is powered by Django APIs and Django Rest Framework (DRF) (🔙). We utilize these technologies to handle data storage, user authentication, and communication between the app and the server. DRF enables us to create robust and secure APIs to support various app functionalities.

Backend also serves as a handler for various cryptocurrency operations. It includes methods for retrieving the real-time value of a cryptocurrency, converting a specified cryptocurrency amount to its equivalent value in another cryptocurrency or blu coin.
